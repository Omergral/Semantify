    <em>Semantify offers a method to create and edit a 3D parametric model using semantically meaningful descriptors. Semantify is based on a self-supervised method that utilizes the semantic power of CLIP language-vision model to build a mapping between semantic descriptors to 3DMM model coefficients. This can be used in an interactive application defining a slider for each descriptor (a), or to fit a model to an image in a zero shot manner by feeding the image into CLIP and obtaining a vector of semantic scores that can be mapped to shape parameters (b)</em>
